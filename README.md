# sep-seclog-ips-parser
Symantec Endpoint Protection Seclog IP Analyzer

Try to find for attacker IP addresses in the seclog file and block if the number of attacks exceeds a certain number.

SEP firewall rule blocking:
1. Export current rules
2. Add IP addresses to the predefined rule.
4. Import rules into SEP
Simple and works fine.


Settings in the config file.
